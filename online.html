                <h2>What?</h2>
                <p>This website is for when you try to open Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc
                on a wifi network, and nothing happens. Type "http://<domain>internetcheck.xyz</domain>"
                into your browser's url bar, and you'll be able to log on.</p>

                <h2>How?</h2>
                <p><domain>internetcheck.xyz</domain> will never use SSL (also known as TLS). No
                encryption, no strong authentication, no <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a>,
                no HTTP/2.0, just plain old unencrypted HTTP and forever stuck in the dark
                ages of internet security.</p> 

                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>Normally, that's a bad idea. You should always use SSL and secure
                encryption when possible. In fact, it's such a bad idea that most websites
                are now using https by default.</p>
                
                <p>And that's great, but it also means that if you're relying on
                poorly-behaved wifi networks, it can be hard to get online.  Secure
                browsers and websites using https make it impossible for those wifi
                networks to send you to a login or payment page. Basically, those networks
                can't tap into your connection just like attackers can't. Modern browsers
                are so good that they can remember when a website supports encryption and
                even if you type in the website name, they'll use https.</p> 

                <p>And if the network never redirects you to this page, well as you can
                see, you're not missing much.</p>
