 * Welcome to my HoneyPot
 * If you notice requests for this file, you're
 * probably running/using a malicious site.
 *
 * I have purchased this domain for other reasons,
 * and I noticed the high volume of traffic.
 * I am currently hosting this to trace the source out,
 * then hopefully try to do clean it up.
 * The only data collected is the location of the
 * site/extension requesting this file.
 * 
 * Please, do not blacklist this domain. There's a better
 * future for it. I only have this here to hopefully
 * discover more information, and then reach out to the
 * proper contacts to inform them of the malicious code.
 * 
 * Supposedly this was used for injecting ads (adware)
 * with cloned browser extensions, which is kinda lame.
 * 
 * Let's work together to make the web better.
